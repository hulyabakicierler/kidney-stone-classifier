# ðŸ§  Kidney Stone Detection from Ultrasound Images with CNN + Streamlit

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based web application that classifies kidney stone presence in ultrasound images using a CNN model.

## ðŸ’» Web App
Built with **Streamlit**, the app allows users to upload ultrasound images and get instant predictions.

### ðŸ§ª Model Summary
- Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Input shape: 240x240 grayscale images
- Accuracy: ~100% on validation data
- Dataset source: [Kaggle - Kidney Stone Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

### ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- Pillow
- NumPy

### ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
streamlit run app.py
# kidney-stone-classifier
Kidney stone detection using a CNN-based image classifier trained on ultrasound images. Deployed via Streamlit for real-time predictions.
